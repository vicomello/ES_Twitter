When you answer the first short survey, $5 will be added into your final compensation. The more surveys you answer, the greater the financial compensation you will receive at the end of the study.

Twitter's API (short for Application Programming Interface) is a software that allows researchers to read Twitter's public data. That information is available for free to researchers. The information collected (e.g: tweets, likes, and retweets) will be used for research purposes only. If we successfully retrieve your Twitter data from Twitter's API (meaning that the handle you provided is valid an that it is an open account), you will get a bonus of $5.<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>Note that the maximum amount you can earn in this study is $25 ($5 + $15 + $5).<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>Note that the participation in a research stage is dependent on the previous one.
